# Quiz App

The Quiz App is a C++ program that simulates a quiz game allowing users to answer a series of pre-defined questions. Users are prompted through a command-line interface to answer questions and receive immediate feedback on their responses.

## Overview

This program implements a simple quiz game that presents a set of questions with predefined answers. It allows users to input their answers, providing feedback on correctness and accumulating a total score based on correct responses.

## Features

- **Interactive Quiz Experience**: Engages users with a series of questions and provides immediate feedback on their answers.
- **Multiple Questions**: Features ten questions with preset multiple-choice answers.
- **Scoring System**: Calculates and displays the total score at the end of the quiz.

## Usage

1. Compile the C++ code using a C++ compiler in your preferred development environment.
2. Run the compiled program in the terminal or command prompt.
3. Answer each question by entering the corresponding number (1, 2, 3, or 4) for your choice.
4. Receive immediate feedback on the correctness of your answers and your total score at the end of the quiz.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository containing the C++ source code for the Quiz App.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable file in your command-line interface.

## Code Overview

The program prompts users to answer ten pre-defined questions, evaluating the correctness of their responses and accumulating a total score. It utilizes a simple command-line interface to interact with the user.

## Example

An example interaction with the program:

```bash
THE DAILY QUIZ

Press Enter to start the quiz...
What is your name?
[User inputs their name]
How old are you?
[User inputs their age]
Are you ready to take the quiz [Name]? yes/no
[User inputs 'yes']
[Quiz questions are presented, and user inputs answers]
Total Score = [User's total score] out of 100
[Final result: Passed or Failed based on the score]
```
